### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that an .svg file can be used directly as an image. I also explored flex-direction, understanding that placing any tags within a div set to display: flex aligns them side-by-side, as flex-direction defaults to row.

### Continued development

Should learn about CSS grid and position attribute.
